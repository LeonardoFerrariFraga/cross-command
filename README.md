# Cross Command - Design Patterns Programming Sample

## Select Units, schedule commands, press play, and watch your Units come to life to fulfill your wishes!

A small Unity 6 project displaying the usage of Design Patterns, OOP, and SOLID principles!

In the last 4 years as a professional Unity developer, I neglected GitHub, leaving only old projects with a questionable coding approach that does not reflect my experience. Cross Command is the first of many new projects I intend to make.

This project is mainly intended to display programming experience and Unity knowledge, but there are also plans to utilize it as a helpful sample for programmers wanting to learn more. Coding patterns, although simple to understand, may leave new learners stuck on when and where to apply them. Concrete examples of common scenarios may prove extremely helpful.

This project makes (or will make) use of:

* Singleton Pattern
* Command Pattern
* Fluent Builder
* Dependency Injection
* Flyweight Pattern
* Observer Pattern

And moreâ€¦
